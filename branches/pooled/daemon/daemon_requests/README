All files in this directory are called daemon_request_<foo>.{c,h}, where foo is
one of the commands from the daemon/daemon protocol. When receiving the <foo>
command, the daemon runs daemon_request_<foo> (). 


There is only one exception : the list command.

- Foo and Bar are our clients (running on dumb machines)
- D0 is our daemon, running on the real machine.
- D1 is another daemon. There could be more, but that does not really matter.


- Let's say that Foo sends "list" to D0.
- Then D0 will send "list" to all known daemons (well, that is the dummy
  implementation, but eh)
- blah
