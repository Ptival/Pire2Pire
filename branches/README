* What the fuck is this ?
-------------------------
A server and a client interacting using sockets. This seems kind of related to
the project. Amazing, isn't it ?


* What is different from the trunk version ?
--------------------------------------------
- there is a client ! No need to use Telnet no more (the double negative still
  has a long TTL, though).
- read () is only used to ask the user to write text. This might eat up your
  CPU, should be tested.
- instead of using read () and write () directly on sockets, these two wonderful
  programs use the send () and recv () functions. Is that better ? Hell, I have
  no idea. It is definitely something that we gotta talk to our teachers about.
- some useful shit is now in util.{c,h}, which makes the actual code (yep, the
  one that matters) easier to read.

* kay, what is just the same ?
------------------------------
- the incredible idea of forking after starting to listen, and to handle every
  client using a different process. Definitely cool, even though not as cool as
  using threads.
- the behaviour of the whole program : a client sends some text to the server,
  that prints it and sends it back to the client, etc.

* Wow, that shit seems cool dude, how do I use it ?
----------------------------------------------------
Compiling :
$ make all

First term :
./myserver

Other terms (note that you cannot run the client too many times) :
./client 127.0.0.1 1338
