* Overview
----------
This daemon is sent different requests /via/ a socket, and handles them using
threads. Many clients and requests may be handled at the same time.



* How to use the daemon ?
-------------------------
It should be used with the bash script that can be found in bin/. It allows
users to properly start/stop/restart the daemon.


* How does it work ?
--------------------
When accepting an incoming connection, the daemon creates a new thread that will
handle the client. Note that, right after this thread has been created, another
client can try and reach the daemon. Indeed, there is no need to wait for the
first client to disconnect from the daemon to allow another one to start
working.

A thread dedicated to a client keeps reading from the socket, until the "quit"
message is sent by the client. It creates a new thread for every valid command
received. Note that the user can send a request without waiting for the
previous one to return : all requests are handled simultaneously.
